Welcome to the Soenneker Fixtures Integration repository! This project provides a reusable and generic integration test xUnit fixture. It dynamically registers and configures `WebApplicationFactory` instances for multiple ASP.NET Core projects. With support for custom app settings, authentication, logging, and test utilities, this library is designed to simplify your testing experience.

- **Dynamic Configuration**: Automatically configure the `WebApplicationFactory` based on your project's requirements.
- **Support for Custom Settings**: Use your application's configuration settings, making it easier to integrate into your existing workflows.
- **Authentication**: Simplify the process of authenticating users in your tests.
- **Logging Utilities**: Integrate logging capabilities to help diagnose issues during testing.
- **Test Utilities**: Leverage built-in utilities that enhance the testing process.

## Installation

To get started with Soenneker Fixtures Integration, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sayfulla000/soenneker.fixtures.integration.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd soenneker.fixtures.integration
   ```

3. Add the NuGet package to your project:

   ```bash
   dotnet add package Soenneker.Fixtures.Integration
   ```

4. Restore your project dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can easily integrate the fixture into your xUnit tests. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

### Step 1: Create a Test Class

Start by creating a test class in your project.

```csharp
public class MyIntegrationTests : IClassFixture<MyCustomFixture>
{
    private readonly MyCustomFixture _fixture;

    public MyIntegrationTests(MyCustomFixture fixture)
    {
        _fixture = fixture;
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task Test1()
    {
        var client = _fixture.CreateClient();
        // Write your test logic here
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the Fixture

Your fixture should inherit from the `WebApplicationFactory<TStartup>` class.

```csharp
public class MyCustomFixture : WebApplicationFactory<Startup>
{
    protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)
    {
        // Custom configurations go here
    }
}
```

## Configuration Options

### App Settings

You can define custom app settings in your test fixture. These settings will override the default ones during testing.

```csharp
public class MyCustomFixture : WebApplicationFactory<Startup>
{
    protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, config) =>
        {
            config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.Test.json");
        });
    }
}
```

### Authentication

To configure authentication, you can set up a test user in your fixture.

```csharp
protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)
{
    builder.ConfigureServices(services =>
    {
        // Add authentication services
        services.AddAuthentication("Test")
            .AddCookie("Test", options => {
                options.Events.OnValidatePrincipal = context => {
                    // Add test user logic
                    return Task.CompletedTask;
                };
            });
    });
}
```

### Logging

You can also set up logging to help with diagnosing issues.

```csharp
protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)
{
    builder.ConfigureLogging(logging =>
    {
        logging.ClearProviders();
        logging.AddConsole();
    });
}
```

## Example

Here's a full example of a test using the fixture:

```csharp
public class MyIntegrationTests : IClassFixture<MyCustomFixture>
{
    private readonly HttpClient _client;

    public MyIntegrationTests(MyCustomFixture fixture)
    {
        _client = fixture.CreateClient();
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task Get_Endpoint_Returns_Success()
    {
        var response = await _client.GetAsync("/api/values");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

        var responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        Assert.Contains("expectedValue", responseBody);
    }
}
```
